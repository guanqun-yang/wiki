Introduction
============

As a person who loves to keep everything organized, I sometimes find it
insufficient to keep relevant resources in bookmark bar since I, with
high probability, will end up forgetting they are there and wasting time
discover them repeatedly. Therefore, I decide to set up this repository
to stash the gems I find during daily learning and research.

The organization of this repository follows five topics I listed in
prologue plus two additional non-technical topics

#. General articles on research, career and life I find beneficial. Note
   even for non-English articles, I will generally use their (probably
   inaccurate) English translation since Emacs does not support
   efficient non-English (especially Chinese) input.

#. Research tools/softwares not listed in `Awesome Research
   Tools <https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research>`__ created by
   Lei Ma, whose notes on his/her statistical physics courses motivated
   me to create this whole set of notes.

Commenting LaTex articles
-------------------------

-  `latexdiff <http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/support/latexdiff/doc/latexdiff-man.pdf>`__

   It is a Perl script that compares the differences of two ``.tex``
   source files and marks the significant differences between them,
   which could be used for commenting manuscripts.

-  Using Git

   See `this
   post <https://www.zhihu.com/question/22316670/answer/131793794>`__
   (in Chinese), which utilizes git to do version control on
   manuscripts. But this seems to be useful for individual person who is
   working on notes rather than collaboration on papers.

-  Direct conversion to MSWord readable format

   -  latex2rtf: convert to ``.rtf`` file.

   -  `pandoc <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html>`__: convert to ``.odt``
      file.

   -  More solutions could be found
      `here <https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/111886/how-to-convert-a-scientific-manuscript-from-latex-to-word-using-pandoc>`__.
