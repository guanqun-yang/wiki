Research Resources Repository

Introduction
============

As a person who loves to keep everything organized, I sometimes find it
insufficient to keep relevant resources in bookmark bar since I, with
high probability, will end up forgetting they are there and wasting time
discover them repeatedly. Therefore, I decide to set up this repository
to stash the gems I find during daily learning and research.

The organization of this repository follows five topics I listed in
prologue plus two additional non-technical topics

#. General articles on research, career and life I find beneficial. Note
   even for non-English articles, I will generally use their (probably
   inaccurate) English translation since Emacs does not support
   efficient non-English (especially Chinese) input.

#. Research tools/softwares not listed in `Awesome Research
   Tools <https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research>`__ created by
   Lei Ma, whose notes on his/her statistical physics courses motivated
   me to create this whole set of notes.

   Optimization <http://web.stanford.edu/~jduchi/projects/general_notes.pdf>`__

   Papers <https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers>`__

   -  A collection of papers **by topic** from 2012 to 2016 selected
      according to their number of citations. This list could be used in
      companion with the previous one, especially when reading papers
      from the methods and applications section.

   -  A `Python
      script <https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers/blob/master/fetch_papers.py>`__
      that could download all the papers in the list.

-  `Awesome Deep
   Vision <https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision>`__

   -  A list of papers (by topic), courses, books and many other
      resources of computer vision using deep learning methods.

-  `Awesome Computer
   Vision <https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision>`__

   -  A pretty extensive list that includes resources not only in
      computer vision, but also `resources for
      students <https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision#resources-for-students>`__,
      like writing and presenting.

-  `Academic Genealogy in Computer
   Vision <https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision/blob/master/people.md>`__

   -  Interviews of one hundred scholars around world with different
      backgrounds who thrive in the publish-or-perish environment.


Tools
~~~~~

-  `5 Classic Presentation
   Fonts <https://thepresentationdesigner.co.uk/5-classic-presentation-fonts/>`__

   -  Five fonts (``Helvetica``, ``Garamond`` and others) and their
      history well-suited for presentation. To use the fonts mentioned,
      go to `here (for
      Helvetica) <https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/121061/working-with-arial-or-helvetica-fonts>`__
      or `here (for
      Garamond) <https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/406816/how-can-i-get-a-garamond-font>`__.


PhD Application

PhD Life
--------

-  `My eight years of doing PhD -
   Academics <https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/50597445>`__ by `Dr. Yun
   Wang <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yunwang/>`__ (in Chinese)

-  `My eight years of doing PhD -
   Fun <https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/50667670>`__ by `Dr. Yun
   Wang <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yunwang/>`__ (in Chinese)

-  `How to be a happy and productive
   writer <https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI1OTA4Mjk3NA==&mid=2650830984&idx=1&sn=f963f564dfe1e01996e3c4545fd5c793>`__
   by `Dr. Qian Yue <https://sociology.ubc.ca/profile/yue-qian/>`__ (in
   Chinese)

   -  Note: This is a verbatim of a workshop mainly discussing
      reading-writing cycle for PhD research in sociology. Even though
      the voices come from a different discipline than engineering, the
      methology, to my opinion, is largely the same and feels relatable
      to my personal experiences.

   -  Her `weibo
      post <https://www.weibo.com/p/1001603935693545055068>`__ on the
      same topic, but in more details (in Chinese).

-  `How to manage your time, emotion, research progress as re-tenure
   faculty
   members? <https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/50iNupppOyGLDt4cJmYk3Q>`__ by
   `Dr. Qian Yue <https://sociology.ubc.ca/profile/yue-qian/>`__ (in
   Chinese)

   -  Note: This is an article talking about the author’s first year as
      an assistant professor in sociology. Although I am currently still
      a student, the time/emotion management part is pretty useful. At
      the same time, since we are both abroad, the feelings about life
      in a different country somehow synchronize.


Career

Research Tools
==============


Commenting LaTex Articles
-------------------------

-  `latexdiff <http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/support/latexdiff/doc/latexdiff-man.pdf>`__

   It is a Perl script that compares the differences of two ``.tex``
   source files and marks the significant differences between them,
   which could be used for commenting manuscripts.

-  Using Git

   See `this
   post <https://www.zhihu.com/question/22316670/answer/131793794>`__
   (in Chinese), which utilizes git to do version control on
   manuscripts. But this seems to be useful for individual person who is
   working on notes rather than collaboration on papers.

-  Direct conversion to MSWord readable format

   -  latex2rtf: convert to ``.rtf`` file.

   -  `pandoc <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html>`__: convert to ``.odt``
      file.

   -  More solutions could be found
      `here <https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/111886/how-to-convert-a-scientific-manuscript-from-latex-to-word-using-pandoc>`__.

-  Using Overleaf


Visualizing Data
----------------

-  *Handbook of Data Visualization* by `Dr. Chun-Houh
   Chen <http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/library/anniversary/people/faculty/faculty_cchen.htm>`__

   A good starting point to choose the appropriate format to present
   complex relations among variables using graph. An example to
   visualize 20 variables done by author’s group could be found
   `here <http://gap.stat.sinica.edu.tw/3476.pdf>`__ (in Chinese).
