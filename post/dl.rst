Introduction
============

| This set of notes come from two courses

-  | ECE 239AS: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

-  | CS 269: Current Topics in Artificial Intelligence

| Since a success of a deep learning application primarily hinges on the
  choice
| of architecture, loss function and optimization methods, this set of
  notes will
| be divided into sections correspond to these topics.
