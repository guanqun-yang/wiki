Who am I
========

My name is Guanqun Yang, and I am a second year master student in
Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA. My research interests
include statistical machine and its applications. You could learn more
about me `here <https://guanqun-yang.github.io>`__.

Motivation
==========

Past experiences tell me how important it is to cherish the learning
experiences I have. Even though learning here might refer to something
other than school education like what I have learned about purely out of
curiosity, it is still preferable to organize these information,
believing they could serve certain purpose one day. As for the formal
courses I take, some sort of organization is **always** made by physical
or digit notes (many thanks `BoostNote <https://boostnote.io>`__, the
best note-taking software I have used). However, such organization still
looks messy to me and I started looking for a way to **clearly**
organize what I have learned for a period (say, a quarter). It seems
that there are many things I could use and I tried many of them, but
they are all somehow disappointing

-  WordPress/Wix/Weebly: They are the go-to choices for personal
   blogging and there are some amazing examples, like `Terrence Tao's
   blog <https://terrytao.wordpress.com/>`__ generated by WordPress.
   However, these services serve pretty diverse purposes and look less
   professional and some advanced features are non-free, I finally gave
   up after some efforts.
-  Website from scratch: Since professional technical blogging is my
   ultimate goal, I thought of this because of its high-customizability.
   However, it turns out it is much more expensive than the previous
   choice and involves much more time spending.
-  GitBook: This is a service to host software's documentation and one
   of my friends uses this as his technical blog (see
   `CharlesNotes <https://notes.pythonic.life/>`__). Even though he
   claims that this is the optimal way for personal blogging, I find it
   still disappointing since some limitation GitBook poses on the users
   (again, advanced features is non-free).

Despite all of these disappointments, I kept looking for alternatives
and I finally found `this
site <http://statisticalphysics.openmetric.org/>`__, where the author
hosted his/her notes for the statistical physics course he/she took. I
also realized that I could actually host my notes like software's
documentation. Staying on the right track by combining these two ideas,
I got everything configuration/deployment in less than one day and
therefore the site you see here.

Plan
====

The following notes will be compiled and hosted on this site

-  Linear algebra
-  Convex optimization
-  Statistical machine learning
-  Deep learning
-  My current research
