Who am I
========

My name is Guanqun Yang, and I am a second-year master student in
Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA. My research interests
include statistical machine and its applications. You could learn more
about me `here <https://guanqun-yang.github.io>`__.

Motivation
==========

Past experiences tell me how important it is to cherish the learning
experiences I have. Even though learning here might refer to something
other than school education like what I have learned about purely out of
curiosity, it is still preferable to organize this information,
believing they could serve a certain purpose one day. As for the formal
courses I take, some sort of organization is **always** made by physical
or digit notes (many thanks `BoostNote <https://boostnote.io>`__, the
best note-taking software I have used). However, such organization still
looks messy to me and I started looking for a way to **clearly**
organize what I have learned for a period (say, a quarter). It seems
that there are many things I could use and I tried many of them, but
they are all somehow disappointing

-  WordPress/Wix/Weebly: They are the go-to choices for personal
   blogging and there are some amazing examples, like `Terrence Tao's
   blog <https://terrytao.wordpress.com/>`__ generated by WordPress.
   However, these services serve pretty diverse purposes and look less
   professional and some advanced features are non-free, I finally gave
   up after some efforts.
-  A Website from scratch: Since professional technical blogging is my
   ultimate goal, I thought of this because of its high-customizability.
   However, it turns out it is much more expensive than the previous
   choice and involves much more time spending.
-  GitBook: This is a service to host software's documentation and one
   of my friends uses this as his technical blog (see
   `CharlesNotes <https://notes.pythonic.life/>`__). Even though he
   claims that this is the optimal way for personal blogging, I find it
   still disappointing since some limitation GitBook poses on the users
   (again, advanced features is non-free).

Despite all of these disappointments, I kept looking for alternatives
and I finally found `this
site <http://statisticalphysics.openmetric.org/>`__, where the author
hosted his/her notes for the statistical physics course he/she took. I
also realized that I could actually host my notes like software's
documentation. Staying on the right track by combining these two ideas,
I got everything configuration/deployment in less than one day and
therefore the site you see here.

Plan
====

The following notes will be compiled and hosted on this site

-  Linear algebra
-  Convex optimization
-  Statistical machine learning
-  Deep learning
-  My current research

Notation
========

From the previous experiences, I have spent a lot of time resolving
notation differences resulting from learning with multiple sources. In
the posts I am going to write, I will try to make the notations
consistent.

Here are some guidelines I will abide by:

-  Matrices, probability, expectation will all use square brackets.

   Note a more formal version of probability/expectation signs, i.e.
   :math:`\mathbb{P}` and :math:`\mathbb{E}`, will not be used for
   efficiency.

   -  Example (Markov inequality)

      .. math::


           P[X \geq a] \leq \frac{E[X]}{a}\ (a>0)
           

-  Feature vectors will appear as row vectors in the feature matrix. In
   classification problems, the dataset (both features and labels) could
   be arranged as a matrix.

   Note sometimes it is confusing to use :math:`m` and :math:`n` as
   subscripts simultaneously, so when referring number of examples in
   the dataset, either :math:`m` or :math:`n` will be used. At the same
   time, :math:`p` will be used to represent the number of features in
   feature vector.

   -  Example (dataset rearranged as a matrix)

      .. math::

         \begin{bmatrix}
          \mathbf{x}_1^T& y_1\\
          \mathbf{x}_2^T& y_2\\
          \vdots & \vdots\\
          \mathbf{x}_m^T& y_m
          \end{bmatrix}
