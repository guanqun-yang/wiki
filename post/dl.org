* Introduction
This set of notes come from two courses
+ ECE 239AS: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
+ CS 269: Current Topics in Artificial Intelligence

Since a success of a deep learning application primarily hinges on the choice
of architecture, loss function and optimization methods, this set of notes will
be divided into sections correspond to these topics.

* Loss Function
#+INCLUDE: "dl/hinge.org" :minlevel 3
#+INCLUDE: "dl/softmax.org" :minlevel 3

* Optimization Methods
#+INCLUDE: "dl/gd.org" :minlevel 3

* Architecture
#+INCLUDE: "dl/fc.org" :minlevel 3
